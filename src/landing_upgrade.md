# Dashboard Upgrade Plan 2


Major Creative-as-a-Service vendors use subscription pricing that clusters into two bands: “premium/enterprise” options around several thousand dollars per month and “SMB/unlimited design” options in the low hundreds to low thousands per month.​

Superside
Superside positions as an enterprise CaaS partner with credit-based subscriptions. Public analyses and competitor breakdowns report that Superside’s core “Design Essentials” subscription starts around $5,000 per month for roughly 50 credits, with higher tiers moving toward $9,000 and $13,000+ per month as credit volume and service scope increase. In addition, there is a recurring platform/service fee of about $1,000 per month on many tiers, which covers their project management environment, AI workflows, and tooling integrations.
