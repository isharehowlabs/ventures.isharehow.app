# Dashboard Upgrade Plan 2


Major Creative-as-a-Service vendors use subscription pricing that clusters into two bands: “premium/enterprise” options around several thousand dollars per month and “SMB/unlimited design” options in the low hundreds to low thousands per month.​

Superside
Superside positions as an enterprise CaaS partner with credit-based subscriptions. Public analyses and competitor breakdowns report that Superside’s core “Design Essentials” subscription starts around $5,000 per month for roughly 50 credits, with higher tiers moving toward $9,000 and $13,000+ per month as credit volume and service scope increase. In addition, there is a recurring platform/service fee of about $1,000 per month on many tiers, which covers their project management environment, AI workflows, and tooling integrations.

  @ventures.isharehow.app/src/landing_upgrade.md  I need you to combine my two react .tsx landing pages into one great one. I want it to look like https://venturesisharehowapp.highridgedesigns.multisiteadmin.com/a/preview. Take this  @Landing.tsx (1-900)  page code and import it into the @index.tsx as the full sales page.
